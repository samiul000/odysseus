## Quick Start (Docker)

> `dev` is the default branch and gets the newest changes first. Use [`main`](https://github.com/pewdiepie-archdaemon/odysseus/tree/main) if you want the more curated branch.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pewdiepie-archdaemon/odysseus.git
cd odysseus
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open `http://localhost:7000` when the containers are healthy. The first admin password is printed in `docker compose logs odysseus`.

GPU notes, macOS instructions, HTTPS, and configuration live in the [setup guide](docs/setup.md).

## Run Without Docker

### Linux / macOS (native)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pewdiepie-archdaemon/odysseus.git
cd odysseus
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py
python -m uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 7000
```

Requirements: Python 3.11+. Cookbook also needs `tmux` for background model
downloads and serves (`apt install tmux` / `brew install tmux`).

### Windows (native)

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/pewdiepie-archdaemon/odysseus.git
cd odysseus
.\launch-windows.ps1
```

Or, after adding the project folder to your `PATH`, run from anywhere:

```powershell
.\odysseus
```

> **Tip:** pass custom flags to either command, e.g.
> `odysseus -Port 8080 -BindHost 0.0.0.0`. The first run handles venv
> creation, dependency install, and first-time setup automatically.

The script creates a virtualenv, installs dependencies, runs first-time setup,
and starts the server. Open `http://127.0.0.1:7000` when it finishes.

Requirements: Python 3.11+ ([python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).
For full Cookbook background model downloads and the agent shell tool, install
[Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) (provides `bash.exe`).

> **Local model serving** on Windows is limited to Ollama and llama.cpp (vLLM is
> not supported on Windows). See [WINDOWS.md](WINDOWS.md) for known caveats and
> applied compatibility fixes.

## Features

- **Chat + Agents** — local/API models, tools, MCP, files, shell, skills, and memory.
- **Cookbook** — hardware-aware model recommendations, downloads, and serving.
- **Deep Research** — multi-step web research with source reading and report generation.
- **Compare** — blind side-by-side model testing and synthesis.
- **Documents** — writing-first editor with AI edits, suggestions, Markdown, HTML, CSV, and syntax highlighting.
- **Email** — IMAP/SMTP inbox with triage, tags, summaries, reminders, and reply drafts.
- **Notes, Tasks + Calendar** — reminders, todos, scheduled agent tasks, and CalDAV sync.
- **Extras** — themes, uploads, web search, presets, sessions, and 2FA.

## Contributing

Help is welcome. The best entry points are fresh-install testing, provider setup bugs, mobile/editor polish, docs, and small focused refactors. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## Security

Odysseus is a self-hosted workspace with powerful local tools. Keep auth enabled, keep private data out of Git, and do not expose raw model/service ports publicly. Deployment details are in the [setup guide](docs/setup.md#security-notes).
